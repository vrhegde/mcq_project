# mcq_project
Making a publicly usable database of common english words with their synonyms, antonyms, realated words and unrelated words. This db can be used to automatically create
MCQs that can be used for educational purposes in schools.


Current status:
Two csv files in place. I will use these to programatically compare lists to find common words and thus reduce the need for manual cleanup.
